#summary List of differences between the IDL code and the KML heirarchy

= Introduction =

In general the kdm_kml code tries to map KML properties 1-to-1 to IDL keywords. However this is not always possible. For example, 

  * KML properties have names such as "Altitude" and "AltitudeMode", and IDL does not support keywords like this as the name is ambiguous.
  * A KML Placemark contains a KML Point, but in the IDL implementation the user does not need to manually add a kdm_kml_point to a kdm_kml_placemark. Instead, the user can just pass the latitude, longitude, altitude, and other point properties to the kdm_kml_placemark.

= List of Differences =

  * Wherever KML expects altitudeMode replace it with the IDL x_altitudeMode keyword
  * There is no need to manually add a Point or LineString to a Placemark. The necessary data is passed directly to the Placemark object
  * Wherever KML uses the coordinate tag, you should use lat, lon, and altitude keywords. The coordinate will be generated from these fro you.
