#summary Third Party Libraries Required for KDM-IDL Library

= Introduction =

This code base makes use of various 3rd party IDL libraries. 

Not all of these are used by KDM-IDL, but it would probably be 
a good idea to have them all installed. They may be used in the future,
and they will help your code development.
