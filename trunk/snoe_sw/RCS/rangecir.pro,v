;;; This procedure (RANGECIR) is the opposite of the CIRRANGE
;;; procedure. To learn about CIRRANGE, find by:
;;;
;;; in UNIX:
;;; % find . -name "cirrange.pro"
;;; Then look at its documentation
;;;
;;; in IDL:
;;; IDL> .com cirrange
;;; IDL> HELP, /SOURCE
;;;    or
;;; IDL> doc_library, 'cirrange'
;;;

PRO rangecir, ang

;;; purpose: do the reverse of cirrange. That is, force ang into the
;;; -180 to 180 degree range, rather than 0 to 360

;;; cirrange is used widely and is from the NASA Astronomy Library.
;;; Use the Linux/Unix 'find' command I taught you to see it...

pts = WHERE( ang GT 180 ) 
IF ( pts[ 0 ] NE - 1 ) THEN ang[ pts ] = ang[ pts ] - 360

pts = WHERE( ang LT -180 )
IF ( pts[ 0 ] ne - 1 ) then ang[ pts ] = ang[ pts ] + 360

RETURN
END
